Python Set
----
While doing coding challenges on leetcode, specifically --
[127.Word Ladder](https://leetcode.com/problemset/algorithms/),
I found out some operation for python `set` that I never know.
```python
a = set([a,b,c,d])
b = set([b,d])
a & b # This will produce set([b,d])
      # another way to do this is self.intersection(others)
a -= b # This will turn a into set([a,c])
       # another way to do this is self.difference_update(others)
```


When doing vim setup, I'm having trouble getting tab setting right,
and resolved the issue after consulting the doc. So the rule of thumb
is that you should always set `tabstop=8` because all other values will
make your file appear wrong in other places. Set `softtabstop` and `shiftwidth`
to your desired tab value. I personally like setting the `expandtab` option, which
will insert spaces instead of tab, so that formatting will never be messed up.
