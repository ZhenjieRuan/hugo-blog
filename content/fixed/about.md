Hi there
----
My name is Zhenjie(Jason) Ruan, currently a senior double majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics at Boston University and a part-time SDE at [Liaoyuan.io](https://liaoyuan.io), building apps using React Native. I love CS and programming in general but my particular interests are in Distributed Systems, Operating Systems and Web Development. This blog serves as a place for me to put my random (if not crazy) thoughts and learning notes, as well as a place for me to share my experience to the world. Hope you guys will find something interesting here.
